# 👋 Hello there, I'm Owen Jere (Kenseijin)

🎯 **ICT Specialist | Developer | Systems Support | Educator**

---------------

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a solutions-driven ICT professional with a strong background in systems support, software development, and education. While I’ve spent the past few years focused on infrastructure and teaching, I’m now actively sharpening my programming skills and building tools that solve real-world problems.

### 💡 What Drives Me

- 🔧 **Creating functional, problem-solving applications**
- 💻 **Designing and supporting efficient ICT systems**
- 🧠 **Continuously improving my full-stack development skills**
- 📚 **Sharing knowledge through teaching and mentorship**

### 👨‍💻 Current Technical Focus

- React & modern JavaScript frameworks
- Backend APIs using Node.js and Express
- SQL and relational database design (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Git, GitHub, and version control best practices

### 🛠️ Selected Projects

Here you’ll find a blend of self-initiated and tutorial-inspired projects that reflect my hands-on learning, including:

- [ShowApp 🎬](https://github.com/Kenseijin/ShowApp) – A React app for browsing and managing movies, redesigned from an older tutorial and refactored for clarity and structure.

More projects are in progress as I continue to revisit core skills and push toward modern, scalable solutions.

### 🔄 From Systems to Software

By day, I support ICT systems, manage infrastructure, and drive digital organization across departments. Outside of that, I write code—bridging the gap between technology operations and software innovation.
